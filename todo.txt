create convergence graphs for many experiments of both coin flipping and election running in the simulations. 

The x axis on the graphs is the number of flips in the simulation, and the y axis will be the average of flips in that simulation. The number of simulations to be done should be random, maybe with a slight bias towards the low side, so that it looks real-ish

These will involve a lot of data so they need to either be animated, or be fixed data ahead of time.


Eventually want to use the Dodge transform of observable to make histograms out of various size bubbles, showing the number of votes counted by each machine. 

make the chart generation separate from the simulation, and let the charts be reactive if at all possible.

try to reintroduce some of the clustering that is seen in the original data, and add some covariance between the data location and the likelihood of voting a certain way.
