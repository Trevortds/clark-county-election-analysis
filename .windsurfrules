# Project: Election Visualization
You are building an interactive data visualization about election statistics.

## Tech Stack
- Observable Plot for visualizations  
- Vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- GitHub Pages compatible (static only)
- During development, a Live Server is kept running on localhost:8900, so you don't need to start a web server at any time. 

## Coding Standards
- Use const/let, never var
- Comment complex D3 selections
- All functions should be pure where possible
- Make a small number of changes at a time.

## Key Context
- This project aims to demonstrate statistical concepts
- Assume users have no statistics background
- Prioritize clarity over performance
- This project will eventually be published as a scrolling story on the web, either crafted by hand or using a framework or platform like Idyll or Scrollama.


## Data Processing in Python

- Use type hints consistently
- Optimize for readability over premature optimization
- Follow PEP8 style guide for Python code
